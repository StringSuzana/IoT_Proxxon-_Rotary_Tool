# IoT Proxxon Rotary Tool

## Abstract

It was a lazy afternoon and we were talking what could we do with a handheld drill, scecificaly a rotary tool. Not just any rotary tool, but Proxxon Micromot 50/E. What we wanted to achieve?
Proxxon Micromot 50/E, but with a twist. As you may know (probably not), the Proxxon Micromot 50/E drill doesn't have a good speed regulation. Actually it is old style of regulating RPM's by using a potentiometer and a tryac. Plus added cost of their special power supply. Which is only a transformer with a bridge rectifier and capacitor to weakly smooth the voltage. The concequence of this is that the RPM's are not accurate and also your tork is not as good as you would like. You can stall it easily and perhaps ruin your precious work.
